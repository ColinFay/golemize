This example shows you how to knit an R Markdown document using the two packages **knitr** and **markdown**, and include the HTML output in a shiny app. Note we are using [R Markdown v1](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_migrating_from_v1.html) here, which has a couple of differences with [v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The basic idea is to call `knitr::knit2html()` with the argument `fragment.only = TRUE` to generate a fragment of HTML code.
