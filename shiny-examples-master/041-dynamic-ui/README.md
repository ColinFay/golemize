The user interface components in this example are generated as HTML on the server inside a `renderUI()` block and sent to the client, which displays them with `uiOutput()`. Each time a new component is sent to the client, it completely replaces the previous component. This is different from the udpate input demo app, where the value of an existing input component is changed with a command from the server, but the component itself is not replaced with a new one.
