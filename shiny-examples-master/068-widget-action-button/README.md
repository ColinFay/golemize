    actionButton(inputId, label, icon = NULL)
    
Creates an action button whose value is initially zero. The value advances by one each time the button is pressed. This change can spur an action, even if your app does not directly use the value.

##### Arguments

`inputId` 
The name to use to look up the value of the widget (as a character string)

`label` 
The label to display in the button. This can also be an HTML element such as an image.

`icon` 
Optional icon to appear on the button

_Make this widget by copying the code in ui.R._
