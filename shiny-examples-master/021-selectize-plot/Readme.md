In this example, we use the method `session$registerDataObj()` to register a data object in the shiny session, which we can retrieve via the URL that this method returns (`mapurl` here). Then we update the selectize input so that the choices can be processed on the server side (`server = TRUE`), and we provide a custom rendering method via the selectize initialization options. The rendering method sends a query to `mapurl` with the query variable `state`, which takes the values of the options (`item.value`).

We also provided the `filter` function in `session$registerDataObj()`, which should return an HTTP response based on the `data` registered and the current request `req`. We can extract the query string from `req$QUERY_STRING`, and parse the `state` string. Once we have got the state name, we draw a map of the state as well as a pie chart of the urban population percentage. Finally the plot is returned as an HTTP reponse that has the MIME type `image/png`, and `<img>` tag in the selectize rendering method will get the requested image.

This app also contains a parallel coordinate plot (`renderPlot`) and a data table (`renderDataTable`) that are straightforward to understand and should be familiar to Shiny users.
