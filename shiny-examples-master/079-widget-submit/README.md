    submitButton(text = "Apply Changes", icon = NULL)

    
Creates a submit button. Apps that use a submit button do not update their output as soon as a user makes a change, rather they wait until the user clicks the submit button. This can be a useful way to let your user make several changes and then apply them all at once.

##### Arguments

`text` 
A character string to display in the button

`icon` 
An optional icon to appear in the button

_Make this widget by copying the code in ui.R._
